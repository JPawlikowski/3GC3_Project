3GC3 Project Prototype

The project is a paint ball shooting range, as of now the shooter is stationary
with an arrow-key controlled crosshair which aims where the paintball will be shot from.
The floor and wall are simple flat polygons, the paintballs are created with the 
Paintball.cpp class and drawn with glutSolidSphere. The paintball splatters on the
wall are currently just squares and are created with the Splatter.cpp class. Both 
splatters and paintballs are stored in vectors.

For the final submission we will implement detailed splatters which will have dynamic
shapes and blend colors (for overal splatters).
